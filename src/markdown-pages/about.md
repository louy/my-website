Your ideal candidate for a hands-on VP/Head of Eng. I aspire to
build products & services that improve the quality of people's
lives, while I highly value creativity and excellence


After building and scaling up multiple businesses working with
world-class teams as a consultant I realised that this is my passion
and I want to do it again where I have a stake in the business


I’m a solution architect and a tech lead with about a decade of
experience leading and working with various teams across different
geographies and industries, main skills are in UI/UX, React, NodeJS,
AWS, and Docker. Main industries are retail and banking


I’m also an occasional public speaker, and I’m a big advocate of
transparency across teams, agility and learning from mistakes, and
data-driven decision making
